### Three features of my project

- My web page is built with React Router DOM. That is why it is possible to navigate multiple routes on a single page on my website without any reload.

- I used the Tailwind CSS framework instead of vanilla CSS for my web pages, which allowed me to do all my design-related tasks without any problems. As a result I have been able to give many attractive designs to my web page. And  I have made my website responsive for all types of devices, so my website will look good on all devices.

- Through this website you can help the needy people. There are total four categories in this website, you can donate money in any category you want. And we've presented your donation as a percentage in a pie chart. You can always see this information on our website. Because this data will be stored in your device's local storage.
